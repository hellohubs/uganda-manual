# Power & Solar - System check and restart

This section takes you through the process of safely checking and turning on the power for the Hello Hub. We start by making sure the system is off, then we do a system inspection, and then we turn the system back on.

## Turning the system Off

* Turn off system breaker
* Turn off solar breaker
* Turn off battery breaker

## Power System Inspection

### Solar Panels

Solar panels should be connected as installed and all cables in good condition. 

### Batteries

Batteries should be connected as installed and all cables in good condition. 

### Power to System

Power wires to system server should be connected as installed and in good condition.

### System case

Open the server case and inspect the wires. The power wires should be connected to the power supply and in good condition.

## Turning the system power on

* Turn on battery circuit breaker
* Turn on solar circuit breaker
* Check solar charge controller for proper operation. One of the blue LED's should be lit (assuming daylight)
* Turn on system breaker
* Check for the Power Supply LED to be flashing steadily inside the server case. (or in the case of the system autobooting, the fan should be on).

## Booting up the Hello Hub

### Turn top boxes on

Prior to turning on the system, make sure that the top boxes are powered on. This will allow you to view the boot-up messages and fix any system issues needed at boot.

### Turn the system on

Press the system power button (bottom left of the motherboard mount) briefly to turn the server on. The power supply LED will stop blinking and turn on solid, and the system fan will turn on.

### Booting

After turning the power on, the system will attempt to boot. One of the user terminals will display the BIOS messages (mostly text) and then the Edubuntu system will start. You may see a light colored screen with "Edubuntu" displayed on it. That is a good sign that the system is starting. Depending on system checks, the booting process could take up to 5 minutes to start.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not press any keys on the keyboard while the system is booting, pressing keys may stop the boot process completely and you will have to start over.
